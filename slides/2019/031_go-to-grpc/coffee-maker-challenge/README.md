We (@dersell and @burned42) tried to solve the challenge :)
It's not pretty but it works and we thought it would be nice to share
the code anyway.

As we remembered the constrains where that the coffee maker should be
able to make multiple coffees at the same time and you should be able
to abort each coffee if you like, so that's what we implemented. The
coffee maker produces 10 coffees and you can abort a specific coffee by
typing in the number of the coffee.
