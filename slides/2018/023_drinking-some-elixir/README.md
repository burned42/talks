# #023 /dev/night - Drinking some Elixir

By: [Joseph Varghese](https://bitbucket.org/jvc007/)

Joseph will introduce us to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language which enables you to build distributed, fault-tolerant and maintainable applications by leveraging the Erlang VM (BEAM). We will also talk about the [Open Telecom Platform (OTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) and how it can be used to build distributed application. After that we will build a simple app with Elixir!
