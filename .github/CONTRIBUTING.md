#### Step 2: Suggestion goes through the voting system

Everyone can react to a suggestion with an emoji. Most likely thumps up or down. If you have questions you are also welcome to comment.

#### Step 3: The talk suggestion gets approved

The suggestion has to meet the following criteria to get approved.

1. The talk has to have at least __2__ positive reactions to it. (:thumbsup: :smile: :tada: :hearts:)
2. The talk has to be tagged with the `approved` label from at least one of the [maintainers].

:heavy_exclamation_mark: __Note:__ The numbers can be subject to change.

#### Step 4: Arranging the talk

The [maintainers] will contact you through the email address you provided and arrange the talk with you. You will also be added as a collaborator to the project and the issue for your talk will be assigned to you.

#### Step 5: Providing the slides

You can either __add a comment__ to your initial __issue__ suggesting the talk and add a link to your sildes. Or you can make a [__pull-request__](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) including the following:

* Add your slides to the event folder inside the `sildes` directory.
* Explain how you can view/open the slides in the `README.md` file.
* If there isn't already a folder for the event, please make one as well. These are the conventions:
    - The folder for the event has to reside in the `slides/<year>` folder.
    - The folder name consitst of `<event number>_<event tile>`.

##### Example

```
slides
└── 2017
    └── 010_webweek-special
        └── README.md
```
